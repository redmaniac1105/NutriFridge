This code will be triggered when the user selects the vegetable basket section in our app which will recognize these vegetables.

# Calculating Nutrition Value
Once the list of all the items in the refrigerator has been added our app will return the individual nutrition values of the respective items or the total nutrition value of one particular section or of the entire refrigerator. Under nutrition the following contents will be shown :- Calories, Carbohydrates, Protein, Fats
Based on this the user can find out about his diet . We can even use algorithms to predict the nature of users diet and make suggestion to help the user achieve a more balanced diet.
